       <li> "I love that this show is a depiction of life and I love it for its innocence, about a teen daughter and her mum and their relationship and daily lives in their small town. Nowadays teen shows quite frankly hold nothing back depicting drug use, hypersexuality, mental health issues not to say that these are not realities teens face rather that they dont need to be the focus of all teen shows. constantly. I love their lives for the normality feels like they could be my neighbours down the road. Really sweet show for the whole family." </li> <br> <br> 
       <li> "Even though this is a chick series, tell the truth I really like it. Love it, maybe?. There is something different about this show. Something good that make it so unique, and I'm not talking about fast pace of conversation and loads of sarcasm between each character.  <br>

The story is good and not boring, somewhat very memorable and it going to make you feel very cozy watching it. Plus with good acting and gorgeous girls, this show is so great that I can't find any negativity. (a little bias, I know, but it is that good.) </li>

 Anyway, when did you last see any show that have millions of fans and site especially for it, that how good the show is, and I highly recommend anyone and everyone to watch the show." <br> <br> 
       <li> "I'm on my third round of watching this programme and it just never gets old. Emily Gilmore is hands down the best character. It's funny, emotional, smart, what more can you want from a tv series? Will most definitely be rewatching again in the future." </li> <br> <br>
      <li> "Gilmore Girls is a very good show. The story is great, the humor is very sharp and witty, and there are charming moments throughout the series. There are some good characters. Loralai, Emily, and Paris are my favorite characters.  <br>

 The only negative thing about Gilmore Girls is the character of Rory Gilmore. Rory starts the show off as a smart, clever teenager who loves to read. But then, over time, she becomes an irresponsible, whiny, spoiled brat who makes horrible choices constantly. That makes her quite annoying and the least likable character in the show. But all in all, Gilmore Girls is very funny and enjoyable." </li> <br>
