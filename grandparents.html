      Richard is married to Emily Gilmore and is the father of Lorelai Gilmore and the grandfather of Rory Gilmore. His mother is Lorelai "Trix" Gilmore. Richard is a stern, hard-working, old-fashioned husband and father, who enjoys cigars, golfing and brandy. He rigorously adheres to the traditional life of high society, with its class structures, rules and concepts of appropriate behaviour. He does not tolerate any form of scandal, but shows glimpses of perhaps not a really emotional attachment to the trappings of his and his wife Emily's lifestyle[2][3]. While at moments throughout the show, it's obvious Richard has deep affection[4] and admiration[5] for his daughter, Lorelai, he adheres to the confines of his societal standing, and Emily's broken heart[6], and does not easily forgive Lorelai for leaving the family as a teenager[6]. <br> <br> 

        Emily went to Smith College and was a History major. She is at home in high society, and hosts functions related to Richard's business[1] and her charity work on a weekly basis, and is very finicky about all of the details. She is a person of taste and appreciates fine things. Both she and Richard are well-traveled and have visited Europe many times. This traveling was shared with Rory when the two traveled Europe together.[2] Outside this world of fancy and niceties, she appears incapable of dealing with her emotions, not wanting to show her vulnerability, seeming at times non-compassionate.
